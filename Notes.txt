TODO
- do we need dumping cliques on the gpu?
- add serialization of debug maxes

CURSOR
- do TODOs

BUGS
- ablation study lookahead pruning only gets wrong results sometimes

NOVELTY
- program is split into two parts, for cpu and gpu to allow for use of best hardware
- use unified memory for checking tasks, buffer, and cliques count in search method rather than memcpy
