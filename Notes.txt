TODO

CURSOR
- get transfer buffers scan working by suign less shared memory

BUGS
- ablation study lookahead pruning only gets wrong results sometimes

NOVELTY
- program is split into three parts, seperated by cpu and gpu usage to allow for use of best hardware
- use unified memory for checking tasks, buffer, and cliques count in search method rather than memcpy
